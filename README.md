iTuneMyWalkman
==============

NOTICE: The development of this application was discontinued in 2009. 

iTuneMyWalkman is an open source application that will help you synchronize the
contents of iTunes playlists to your mobile phone or other portable device. The
purpose is to make the process as easy as possible, almost like it is with an
iPod. The application is able to detect when you connect your phone and can
start the synchronization automatically.
